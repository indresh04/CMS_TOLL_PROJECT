            <p>We encourage you to read the following and make yourself aware of the warning signs of the most common kinds of Internet and Email frauds. There are two types of email scams - 'phishing' and 'spoofing'. In both the cases, the 'from address' is forged to make it appear as if it came from a source that it actually did not come from.</p>

            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">What is Phishing?</h2>
            <p>Phishing is an attempt by fraudsters to 'fish' for your personal details. A phishing attempt is usually in the form of an email, which encourages you to click a link that takes you to a fraudulent log-on page designed to capture your account/password/personal details. These emails can also be used to lure the recipient into downloading harmful software. Please note that rosmerhtashrp will never ask you to download software in order to access your information.

            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">What is Spoofing?</h2>
            <p>Spoof emails usually include a fraudulent offer of employment and/or an invitation to perform a monetary transaction. Such email scams are, unfortunately, common across the world and could target anyone - including unsuspecting jobseekers. The sender's address is often disguised and/or the sender may not have provided the entire contact information, such as, the correct physical address, phone numbers and email id.</p>
